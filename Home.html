It originated and is predominantly celebrated in the Indian subcontinent but has also spread to other regions of Asia and parts of the Western world through the South Asian diaspora.</p>
        
        
        <h1 class="text-light">Why is Holi Celebrated</h1>
        <p class="text-warning"style="font-size:20px;" > The festival marks the blooming of spring after a long winter season. It is celebrated on a full-moon day of spring in the Phalguna month of the Hindu calendar.It marks the celebration of the victory of good over evil.</p>

        <h1 class="text-light">How we celebrate holi</h1>
        <p class="text-warning"style="font-size:20px;">Holi celebrations start on the night before Holi with a Holika Dahan where people gather, perform religious rituals in front of the bonfire, and pray that their internal evil be destroyed the way Holika, the sister of the demon king Hiranyakashipu, was killed in the fire. The next morning is celebrated as Rangwali Holi (Dhuleti) a free-for-all festival of colours, where people smear each other with colours and drench each other. Water guns and water-filled balloons are also used to play and colour each other. Anyone and everyone is fair game, friend or stranger, rich or poor, man or woman, children, and elders. The frolic and fight with colours occurs in the open streets, parks, outside temples and buildings.</p>

                <p class="text-warning">Holika Dahan is celebrated by burning Holika, an asuri (demoness). For many traditions in Hinduism, Holi celebrates the victory of good over evil. According to the tradition, people contribute a piece of wood or two for the Holika bonfire, and this represents Holika being consumed by the fire in which she tried to kill her nephew Prahlad, a devotee of God Vishnu and thus Holi gets its name. A similar holiday is Holi where people get to gather and often repair broken relationships.-</p>
